## About
Instance serializator module that's focused on size and time efficiency.
Has a compressing function that can reduce more than 50% the already small output reaching very compact sizes.
Ends up being 20X smaller than the most commum way of serializing Instances.

## Problems(i dont have so much time to that project)
Is on very early stage so there maybe a lot of bugs and it could be wayyy faster and better
* Needs more pre-computing/caching
* Commenting and better structure
* Improve some sketchy functions(GetInstanceChangedProperties, GetSerializedValue, GetInstanceSerializationData, all have kinda bad code)
* Could have a lot of different compressing algo. in the serializing process
