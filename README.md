## About
Instance serializator module that's focused on size and time efficiency.
Has a compressing function that can reduce more than 50% the already small output reaching very compact sizes.
Ends up being 20X smaller than the most commum way of serializing Instances.

### Help developing
Take the code and make sure you are coding it using the same pattern i do, so the codebase does'nt.
Tips:
* Use camelCase when naming variables(ex: thisIsAVariable)
* PascalCase when naming functions(ex: ThisIsAFunction)
