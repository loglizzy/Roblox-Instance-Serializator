# Features
* Focused on smallest size possible
* Compressing

# Problems(i dont have so much time to that project)
Is on very early stage so there maybe a lot of bugs and it could be wayyy faster and better
* Needs more pre-computing/caching
* Commenting and better structure
* Improve some sketchy functions(GetInstanceChangedProperties, GetSerializedValue, GetInstanceSerializationData, all have kinda bad code)
* Could have a lot of different compressing algo. in the serializing process
