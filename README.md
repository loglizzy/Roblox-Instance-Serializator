## Usage
Grab an example place in /examples and see how the working version can be used.
The current usable version is the InstanceSerializer luau file, it's very shallow and to be honest bad, wait until i complete ObjPacker to use a well made product.

## About
Instance serializator module that's focused on size and time efficiency.
Has a compressing function that can reduce more than 50% the already small output reaching very compact sizes.
Ends up being 60X smaller than the most commum way of serializing Instances.
